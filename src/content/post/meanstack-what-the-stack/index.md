This is the second part of stories about stacks related to JavaScript and things. This is a little bit old one but some people still using it. That may their app already involved in a level, it required whole rewrite process to get things back on latest version of it.

Let's get started then. The story starts with the inauguration of the new SPA framework to the world with serious behaviors. There were several flaws with it but ventures started.

## Elements Used

There are four elements used in the MEAN stack

- MongoDB
- Express
- [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/)
- Node

It is all about building a whole new application from the ground up. This stack clearly tells you what to use, where use at glance. This is all about up and running with a fully grown application to serve customers.

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is the database where you should store your data. It is a No-SQL database. In simple, there are no tables to be connected with relations. It only relies on the documents which can be simplified as JSON objects with references. You store your values in documents and the biggest advantage is, it provides the scalability default. You don't have to learn many things about MongoDB, you can get started with little knowledge but there is a lot to learn.

Express and Node go hand to hand. Express, works as the server configuration framework which handles your routing and other awesome stuff you are developing. Node works as a platform provider for your application. Node is light and easy to get started. Minimal configuration made Node a huge candidate in the server world. There are significate drawbacks to using Node as a backend service but there are advantages too.

AngularJS is denoted by 'A' which is the frontend programming language. This stack is a considerably older one but you are able to use it. AngularJS is something easy to earn and easy to grasp. There are a lot of resources to study and a good community to help. People are still using and some people stuck with it because they started developing major applications with it and later find out there are [issues](https://www.toptal.com/angular-js/top-18-most-common-angularjs-developer-mistakes) with the AngularJS framework. Later they resolved those issues and released a major one but the backend compatibility was low. So, people had to stick with the Angular version one.

## Does it worth it?

Regarding the element that using, it required some amount of resources to be implemented. If your application is something that requires some interesting features and scalability with data flow, then you can go for this stack. There is a danger zone, you don't have to stick to the same old concept just give some new juice.

## Future

Even though, this stack is old. You can replace it with the latest version of [Angular](https://angular.io/) which is a much-improved one. It is a feature-rich framework and better ecosystem. It is a little bit different from earlier versions but aligns with the same concepts.

Until next time, see you, folksüëè.
