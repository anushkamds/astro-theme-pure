I am living in a third world country, people would say it is a developing country but I don’t see any development that people think they will have things like other developed countries.
So I would prefer to use that term. in here people are facing numerous life matters, challenges, barriers and so many things that will lead to so many problems in life. S
Somehow people will overcome those and live life simple and healthy for many years without breaking themselves into pieces.

As a human being, you and me aware how it feel like to be human and what we can do. we will work, we will sleep, we will walk, we will play and all the time we will talk.
We use our phones, laptops, personal computer and so and so. if a person is close by to us, we shout and tell the latest news politics, if a little bit far, we will call them and let them know the news.
But if they are in far, far away, we will use Skype, WhatApp or something else because it is the easiest way to reach people we know and we love with out having huge cost of using IDD.
So as a human, we are capable of spreading the new using various methods and medias based on the distance our loving people are.

But there are exceptional that no one ever thought about even the creators of **Skype** or **WhatApp** or **Viber** never thought about this.
Because some people had to use and have to use for all these above three forms of interaction with people.

Before anything else, I would tell a small story to you. as I mentioned earlier, we don’t have that faster train like people have in developed countries.
I use the local commute to go my workplace and come back because it is the fastest and cheapest method in here for traveling rather than stuck in traffic.
So I started to travel in the train which is departed from the station at 8.01. I had a friend with me until for several stations after he gets off, I travel along for some distance.
Usually, I don’t interact with other people and their behaviors. But one particular got my attention, why? because he is looking at his smartphone and doing some _gestures_ toward the phone screen.
So I quickly realized this man who is belong into minor population in our society.
I don’t want to say the disability because what I show next couple of minutes, I realized this man is in more happier than most of the people in our society.

Little by little, I reached near to him and I wanted to talk but I can’t. so I observe this man and his behavior.
He is using Skype and he talks to his friend via Skype and doing that their magical language that I can’t understand.
He calls to other guys and they talked with each other they shared a laugh, they shared thoughts. without saying any word to each other, they laugh with each other.
He doesn’t care about other people think about him he keeps calling several others. he doesn’t mind other people and he doesn’t have to. that the only way he can interact with each other.
That only way he can talk to person or relation who lives very close by to him. only other way he can do it, just by sending a text message.
They may never use voice options in Skype and may be, they don’t know about that feature. but they use most important part of its application.
Video calling which is the only way they can talk and share a thought.

> Differences among deaf people are okay, but we need to recognize those differences and work together.

At that instance, my mind asks me a small question from me.
what are we doing with this advanced technologies? most of the time I was hit by bad news that a man use this technology to look into a naked girl or woman body and kidnapped her, and
then that girl/women suicide due to pressure that mount on her head or a story that they use this technology to get the next big idea to get very large revenue to them.
That kind stories are the typical one we ever heard about and we ever knew about. have you ever thought about this matter.
As a developer I never thought these kinds of scenarios.

Look how people interpret these new technologies to overcome their fears and problems that had before without being a headache to other people who don’t like help these special ones.
Always they have been pushed into corners and they never had this much of closer to each other. they may not talk to each other via mouth but they can talk to each other in their on way.
They can start a revolution or new turn in history because they are in very close range to each other much more than you and me thinking.
