Someone suggested me a documentary about food. The issue was, I didn't have any of these subscription things in stream services because I get addict to that stuff very quickly.
There are ways to watch those, and no need to elaborate on those right now.
I have watched a lot of documentaries even though this was special. [The Game Changer](https://gamechangersmovie.com/).

Initially, I thought, 'Really?'. It was something, and in the meantime, it was an eye-opener for me. I was a fan of meat and preferred to eat anything.
For the first time in my life, I thought, I stopped eating meat and started consuming cuisines with only vegetables. It was a strange feeling, and
I felt like something was missing. Having vegetarian meals and rejecting non-veg food items was a difficult task. Everywhere you go, you will see meat.
Only a few places are offering vegetarian diets.

Then, there was the biggest problem.

> Convincing your family, you are a 'vegetarian'

That was the big issue. I can ignore all other things but convincing my family was the biggest hurdle.
Asking various questions always from me, 'are you having any health issues, tell us don't worry.'.
I just changed my diet plans to vegetarian. Nothing else, I don't have any health issues. People have lots of misconceptions on been vegetarian, and I had to face it all.

Before the change, I wasn't able to complete a 10-minute run or perform 10 push-ups without failing. Doing a burpee was a dream for me. Then the major issue was, maintaining my weight and lower it down. I followed several diet plans and ended up with nothing. Keep thinking, what should I do about this. I followed the intermitted fasting diet plan too. It was something you should try too. I had some results with it but not that significant for me.

With my move, I struggled with meal issues for a little bit. But eventually, I ended on the good side with a good result. There were times, I was thinking about whether I would have any health issues because my waist got shrink in size. That wasn't an immediate effect. A couple of times, I thought to cease this. However, I held those thoughts and stuck with the vegetarian diet for a long time. People said so many things about my diet even though I kept going and have seen so many results.

Today, I don't have any regret of switching to a vegetarian diet. I am capable of completing several push-ups, pull-ups, and dumpees more than I expected. I am maintaining my weight around the 75Kg mark. I didn't attend any fitness course or maintain any diet plan. Only thing I did,
I changed

> "What I eat."

The result is significant and unbelievable. Watch it, spread the word.
