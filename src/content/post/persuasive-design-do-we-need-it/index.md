We all know there are tons of applications that we can use for the same task. For example, there are so many search engines but a lot of people suck with Google. Sometimes, we ask ourselves did we like this application or did it make us use it. You may never know the answer or sometimes you won't bother to find the answer for it as you busy fiddling with that particular application.
So people have thought about it. They are the people who created these applications or help to build those applications. They understood the consequences of what they have created.

Technology has become the main factor in our life right now. In the early stages before social media, we went to cafes, various geographic locations, beaches, and many more because we want to enjoy life. Nowadays we go to places to update the status of presence in that particular place. Even though we don't have any clue where we are. People are considering the main priority as update the status. Even though you think that is a trivial thing, social media make patter of your travel variations and make models specify for you to keep you on the platform more and more. Sometimes you may be exposing vital information about yourself via those things. Find some time and listen to [Jet-Setter episode in Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/84/).

You may say now I am not addicted to that and this. Keep a tab on your time spend on social media platforms, you will see. You may say that I want to check on my friends but when did the last time you check something related to that.

<h2>How deep are we in</h2>

I know some of my friends are scrolling while they were eating. Have you ever bother to check the person next to you while you sitting in a queue or traveling on a bus. I know it's a bad idea to do that but I have done it. 99% of that time, they were on one of the social media platforms, and what they were doing, amazing. Keep adding like all those posts they saw on the wall and share whatever the thing has a text related to current situations. You never know what is going to happen to you and what you are delivering. People have disengaged from the real world and its fundamental qualities and lives in a virtual world. Thinking, it will help you to see everything in this world.

Sometimes people are complaining you can't live without social media platforms. We have been through several world wars, evolutions, and revolutions. None of those were fueled by social media platforms. It's not going to be the world's end if we eliminate it from our life.

<h2>The issue</h2>

The issue is not the platform or its technologies, it is the human physiology. They have hacked it and found a way to keep the mind persuasive state to keep you coming back to the platform. It didn't happen in few days, it is a concatenated effort of several months and several behavioral testing on users. It has been said that a person needs to be engaged with the same routine for 21 days to make it has a habit. Have you ever consider counting days to your addiction to social media platforms. Their algorithms don't target advertisements, they are targeting you and you only. When a world requires money for everything but social media provide unlimited things without asking anything.

<h2>Evade the bullet</h2>

You can't dodge it one go, you will have to keep it doing it. Minimizing the time for those should be the priority. They have designed those platforms in a way to keep you come back. The big step you have to make is, making up your mind because they have already hacked all minds around you. Keeping the control in your hand is the key to the success of evading. You will only see a fabricated world cater to your requirements and not going see the inner side and effects. A machine can give you the result of one or zero of your problem but it will not provide you the bounder beyond your decision.
Keep appreciating the fundamentals human qualities of the life you have given. People are people, they have emotions and feeling which can not be replicated via a machine. You need the experience to understand it and how to act in each situation. It is not a one-tap selection in your post-state area. It's far beyond that. A machine can hack your mind and alter you based on its preferences but you need to keep the control to yourself not to let it happen.
