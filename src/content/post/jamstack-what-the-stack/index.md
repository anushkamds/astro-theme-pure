Once upon a time, a lot of compiler programming languages dominated the internet. After a time, people start using a scripting language for programming because it provides quick feedback on what we have written. Then people started to do research on Javascript and come up with awesome stuff. Nodejs is one thing although there are issues and [Rahl Dhal](https://tinyclouds.org/) has invented a Deno to resolve those which is awesome, Javascript is evolving. Initially started with a scripting language for web browsers.

Enough of history, let's talk about the present. SPA(Single Page Application) was built a long time ago but it revolution the web. So many frameworks and libraries but around that ecosystem. New technology marvels build to help developers to provide a seamless developer experience and less development. There are many stacks to talk but I will start with JAMSTack which creates a new wave.

## Elements Used

There are three elements in JAMStack,

- Javascript
- APIs
- [Markup](https://mdxjs.com/)

These three simple elements are integrated into the stack. Even though elements are small, they give a huge blow to the web world. For the API side, it can be used several things. The [graphql](https://graphql.org/) has been used most of the time because fewer configurations to be done.

Markup is something that helps to write things. Most of [readme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README) files are using this scripting language. In simple words, it helps to write things without leaving the keyboard with most of the typing styles. There are things you can't do but you can use the HTML element inside .MD file. So the versatility of MDX help to gain the prize in JAMStack. Initially, it is very hard to understand what you should write. After a while, you will get used to it.

No need to explains Javascript. It has been used for the backend and frontend. Especially for the frontend side. Most of the time react has been picked for the frontend construction but other frontend frameworks also can be utilized.

## Does it worth it?

It depends on the requirement you are using it for. You can't use it for heavy stuff because it uses basic elements in the web world and no serious backend configurations. It can be used for blogging and static web site mostly. You will able to find templates to start with for your website. You can use those templates and instantly. Fewer configuration steps into a website of your own. In some cases, you only require some knowledge about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You can change your new website and launch it.

The biggest plus point is, you can host your website free. Some providers help you to host your website without any charge with so many options. This is because it pre-renders the pages and contains only basic web elements. Those providers are equipped with so many cutting-edge technologies that will provide an awesome experience to users.

You need to buy your domain which you must do. Everything is not for free. You can use your git repo and connect it provider and they will build the pipeline to make the deployment of your website. So, what you have to make a pull request and reset the thing will be automated. When creating that pull request make sure you have everything is well aligned if not you will have to create another pull request to make it right.

## Why not?

If you are using a WordPress website, you deploy it and then you can share credentials or create a user account for others. In JAMStack, you can do something like that. You will have to share the repo but there are ways to do it. You can use a [headless cms provider](https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/) to update your content. Also, it has been optimized for all resolutions, it is required to make it responsive. What it helps you to do is, you can cave your crazy ideas into your website and expose it to the world in minutes with your git repo.

It is not the silver buttle for your every solution but if you can use that bullet you can make it silver. That is up to you to decide what you can do and many ways to do it.

Until next time folks, keep exploring, stay positive test negative.
